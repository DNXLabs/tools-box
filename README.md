# Welcome to Tools Box! :metal:

Hey there :smile:, so this repository was created with the intention of **sharing scripts** that we use during our day-to-day and that can possibly be used by more work mates or even as a basis to create another script. Please feel free to add and share your scripts with us. :pray:

## Getting Started

To have a better compression on what exists inside this repository, we will try to follow some rules. 

### Folders

All the scripts must be inside off the **scripts** folder. Inside that folder you need to create a folder with your script name and all the contents for your script will be inside of that folder.

```
tools-box
│   README.md
│   LICENSE.md    
│
└───scripts
│   └───hello-world
│       │   hello-world.sh
│       │   README.md
|
|   └───example
│       │   example.sh
│       │   README.md
│       │   ...
```

## Documentation

For your script to be understood by everyone in the project, you will need to create a mini documentation, explaining what your script does, how you should run it, dependencies and requirements. Try to solve all doubts to help the next one mate.

> Inside of the hello-world folder, you will find an example in how to create a documentation. You can copy and paste and just change the values.
